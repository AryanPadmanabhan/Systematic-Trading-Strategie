Then, we will grab each ticker's historical data from the past 360 days with a timeframe of 60 mins. The structure of a Dragon Fly DOJI candle is a doji candle below the previous candle close with an excetionally long tail. To recreate this structure, we will need the closing price, the previous candle close, the low price, and the open price. After grabbing those price points by looping through the initial dataframe, we then set our conditions for the 'buy'. If bought, the position will be set to entered and it will wait for it to change back to none to find another trade. To be set back to none, it will wait for the sell conditions to hit (5% threshold is met). If the 5% move is in the upside, it will count it as a win and vice verse for the 5% move being to the downside. "
